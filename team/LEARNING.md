# React Native Comments
10-11-24 10:30AM

## Benefits
- Like that it live reloads
- Most of us have experience with React, so that transition will be easier
- Helpful to work in something cross platform, as we do not have windows/macs across the board
- Lots of tutorials/resources online to learn React Native, might make it easier to learn how to use the platform

## Challenges
- Having challenged with iOS simulator on XCode, but did work with the Expo App
- We do not have access to all of the features that XCode or Android Studio offer
- There’s a lot of extra fluff that could potentially cause bugs, coding directly with iOS or Android might be a little cleaner, less complicated
