## User Story
Phillip is a second year college student who is feeling overwhelmed and isolated. He feels stressed by his academic workload and struggles to make friends. He sees his roommates chatting about a game where they are working together to grow and trade plants. Phillip downloads the app and enjoys growing his charming virtual garden. Later, he is able to start conversations with classmates around the community goals and get them to play as well, while forming new social connections and destressing from classes.
