## Cappillen Lee
Worked on setting up the template screen for the Shop view. Implemented a design for the entire app. Started with the Authentication views and moved onto the main game view. Added a bunch of pixel art to build a sense of a video game in the design of the app. Helped write code to dynamically display plants sprites. Reorganized the layout of the garden view to compact features and make them accessible. Worked on a in-game purchase feature for unlocking garden plots.
