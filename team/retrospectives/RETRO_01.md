## Action item:
* Goal: Increase communication about team progress via Discord/Slack/Text.

## Optional Takeaways
* All in-progress items should be completed by Monday standup.
* Defining MVP: Pages all exist, can buy a plant, plant a plant, and grow a plant. Placeholder graphics/UI are acceptable, but there must be some UI elements associated with this feature.
