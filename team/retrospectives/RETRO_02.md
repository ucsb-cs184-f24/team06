# Date of Retrospective: November 8, 2024

- **Lead**: Samantha West
- **Present**: Grace Feng, Elijah Frankle, Cappillen Lee, Samantha West, Sophia Tran, Richard Fang
- **Absent**: None

## Action Item

- **Goal**: Have concrete goals with timelines for the rest of the quarter.
- **Change**: Create a timelined list for all the features we want to implement, specifying what each person should accomplish and exactly when each task should be completed.
- **Measurement**: Our ability to follow through on the plans.

## Optional Takeaways

- Extra communication over Discord/Text, as outlined in the previous Retro, helped us address issues and approve PRs faster.
- Plan to expand on the UI/interface of Plant Crossing by implementing sprites and a cohesive theme.

## Retro Assessment

- **Retro Outline/Process Used**: We followed the outline provided in the First Retrospective page on Canvas.
- **Assessment of How It Went**: The meeting went fairly quickly, and we reached a consensus on our goals for this retro.
- **Advice for Future Retros**: Review the retro format before beginning and ensure all key points are covered.

## Outcome

The new timeline-based approach worked really well. We now have a much clearer picture of what needs to be done for the rest of the quarter, and the timeline is helping us keep to our specific goals. Having specific deadlines is particularly motivating, and we have found it helpful to see our individual tasks mapped out.
